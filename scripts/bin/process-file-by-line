#! /usr/bin/env bash

# Utility for something I often need. Process a file line-by-line, removing the line on successful completion.
# If `cmd` exits with exit code 0 the line is moved to `file.sucess`. If it exists with another exit code
# it is moved to `file.failure`. This handles aborts gracefully (the command will abort, the line will
# remain in the original file).
# It can even handle additions and removals to the file at runtime.

# Typical usage: Have some queue of files to process. That is usually a long-running unattended process.
# Failures can be dealt with after the fact, the process can be aboarted and picked up again any time.
